* Explore making both Field and Model return a single ConstraintResult.
* Explore adding a stop point in the constraints.
* Create a single function for parsing constraints and use it everywhere.
* Create a single function for executing a series of constraints and use it everywhere.
  All the meta constraints and the field constraints would benefit from this.
* Add a message portion to the Field so it can be inherited by the FieldConstraint.
* Start polishing the test methods across the board so they actually return the errors.
* Make a parsing model and test against it before parsing.
* Move all parse methods from the constraints to the module header.
* Make a yaml parser that uses libyaml to create clove value and parse clove to yaml.
* Create an issue to explore using a different container other than vector to enable constexpr
  models.
