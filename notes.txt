* Make a parsing model and test against it before parsing.

  When making the Python module, take a look at this:
  https://github.com/python-rapidjson/python-rapidjson

  2. Add optional get_string_length and get_list_length methods.
  5. Attempt to add support for JSON Schema so we can produce some metrics.
  6. Python module test run.

Make sure resolve doesn't use make_unique and it just relied on get_view() functions repeatedly.
