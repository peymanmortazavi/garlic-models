* Explore making both Field and Model return a single ConstraintResult.
* Start polishing the test methods across the board so they actually return the errors.
* Make a parsing model and test against it before parsing.
* Move all parse methods from the constraints to the module header.
* Make a yaml parser that uses libyaml to create clove value and parse clove to yaml.
* Create an issue to explore using a different container other than vector to enable constexpr
  models.

  When making the Python module, take a look at this:
  https://github.com/python-rapidjson/python-rapidjson

  Update the libyaml module to allow using an existing initialized emitter.

  1. Make sure using string_view is actually speeding up stuff compared to strlen getting called.
  2. Add optional get_string_length and get_list_length methods.
  3. Attempt to decouple Model and Module from parsing as much as possible.
  4. Work on CI and previous compilers before addressing new constraints.
  5. Attempt to add support for JSON Schema so we can produce some metrics.
  6. Python module test run.
