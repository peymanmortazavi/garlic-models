Fix the library installation:
  - move installation part from the root CMakeLists.txt to the src/CMakeLists.txt
  - make sure public headers work fine while DRY (no duplication of includes).

Future improvement:
  - add back inserter and shit like that.
  - work on optimizing the clove data structure and use libyaml to parse into clove.
  - use template structure to support adding decoders from ReadableLayer to any class typ
  - provide an easy to use C library to use garlic library.
  - provide some performance metrics to examine the performance of this library.

Nice Improvements:
  - lower memory footprint of GenericCloveData by utilizing pointers for arrays and maps.
  - explore using an actual hash table for the GenericCloveData
  - explore using a linked list for GenericCloveData
  - use build system to enable/disable JSON.
  - provide more friendly tools for adding new providers, like a class that would take in
    a convertor and then build out the rest of the functionality. Like provide the way to create
    a string and then use that to automatically provide all the add_member methods.

P 0:
    * really learn about the STL iterators and make a tutorial video out of it.

P 1:
    - use a private parse method to assume valid and a public parse that uses an internal model to first validate the
      schema.
    - use a message pack like structure to store models in a memory-optimized way.
