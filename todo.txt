Future improvement:
  - provide some performance metrics to examine the performance of this library.

Nice Improvements:
  - provide more friendly tools for adding new providers, like a class that would take in

P 0:
    * really learn about the STL iterators and make a tutorial video out of it.

P 1:
    - use a private parse method to assume valid and a public parse that uses an internal model to first validate the
      schema.
    - use a message pack like structure to store models in a memory-optimized way.
