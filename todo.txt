Fix the library installation:
  - move installation part from the root CMakeLists.txt to the src/CMakeLists.txt
  - make the tests work.
  - make sure public headers work fine while DRY (no duplication of includes).

Future improvement:
  - add back inserter and shit like that.

Nice Improvements:
  - separate different parts of header files from garlic.h
  - lower memory footprint of GenericCloveData by utilizing pointers for arrays and maps.
  - explore using an actual hash table for the GenericCloveData
  - explore using a linked list for GenericCloveData
  - use build system to enable/disable JSON.

IMPORTANT:
	* one way we could maybe try to reduce the complexity of this code is to
	  have one readable and one writable protocol. write tests for these and make sure
		they work properly and then have one config manager that would OPTIONALLY use shared pointers
		to reduce CPU performance but reduce memory foot print. the existence of that shared pointer
		would allow the object to get merged properly.


P 0:
    * really learn about the STL iterators and make a tutorial video out of it.

P 1:
    - build constraints from the ReadableLayer [almost complete]
    - use a private parse method to assume valid and a public parse that uses an internal model to first validate the
      schema.
